Warehouse Robot Path Optimization
This project demonstrates a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the path of a robot navigating through a warehouse grid. The robot avoids obstacles, collects items, and interacts with dynamic human movements while maximizing its rewards. The Q-learning algorithm is used to train the agent, and the visualization of the training process is provided using Tkinter.

Project Overview
The main objectives of the project include:

Implementing a Q-learning-based reinforcement learning algorithm.
Navigating through a grid-based warehouse environment.
Avoiding collisions with obstacles and humans.
Collecting all target items in the warehouse.
Visualizing the robot's movement and the learned policy in real time.
Features
Grid-Based Environment:
A customizable warehouse grid with obstacles, humans, and target items.
Dynamic Obstacles:
Humans move randomly, introducing dynamic challenges to the agent's navigation.
Visualization:
The training process is visualized using a GUI (Tkinter). The learned policy can also be displayed using arrows.
Reward System:
Designed to incentivize efficient navigation and penalize undesirable actions (e.g., collisions).
Hyperparameter Optimization:
Support for hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
Technologies Used
Python
NumPy - Efficient grid and Q-table computations.
Tkinter - GUI visualization for agent movement.
Matplotlib - Plotting the training rewards.
Optuna - Hyperparameter optimization for Q-learning parameters.

How to Run the Project
Execute the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Watch the robot navigate through the warehouse grid:

Observe its interactions with the environment.
Visualize the rewards and training progression.
Adjust parameters such as grid size, learning rate, and epsilon in the script to customize the training process.

Key Parameters
The key hyperparameters for training the agent are:

grid_size (int): Size of the warehouse grid.
learning_rate (float): Step size for Q-learning updates.
discount_factor (float): Discount factor for future rewards.
epsilon (float): Exploration rate for the ε-greedy policy.
epsilon_decay (float): Decay rate for ε to reduce exploration over time.
episodes (int): Number of training episodes.
max_steps (int): Maximum steps allowed per episode.
Hyperparameter Tuning
The project integrates Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.
To perform tuning, you can run a modified script that uses Optuna to search for the best combination of hyperparameters:

Example snippet:

python
Copy code
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    learning_rate = trial.suggest_float("learning_rate", 0.01, 0.5)
    discount_factor = trial.suggest_float("discount_factor", 0.5, 0.9)
    epsilon_decay = trial.suggest_float("epsilon_decay", 0.9, 0.999)

    rewards = train_agent(grid, q_tables, visualizer, targets, start=(0, 0), 
                          learning_rate=learning_rate, discount_factor=discount_factor, epsilon_decay=epsilon_decay)
    return sum(rewards) / len(rewards)

study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)
print(study.best_params)
Results
Rewards Plot:
The script will generate a plot of total rewards over episodes to analyze the agent's learning progression.
Policy Visualization:
The final learned policy is visualized on the grid using directional arrows.
